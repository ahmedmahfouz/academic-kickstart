I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Human Genetics at Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). I am also a member of the [Leiden Computational Biology Center](https://www.lcbc.nl/).

My research focuses on developing and applying machine learning and statistics to solve complex biological problems. I am particularly interested in single cell data analysis to study the cellular diversity as well as alterations in specific cell populations due to disease.
